## Agenda

- DICOMv4
  - Lots of concerns about effort required - v3 took a lot of time
  - still working towards a report
  - Good discussion on open source and v4 -
    - idea that there should be open source reference implementation of anything standard
  - Undefined length sequences
    - defined lengths let you do skip parsing
    - undefined lengths let you handle data > 4GB (lengths are 32 bit ints)
    - undefined lengths let you do stream data generation
- DICOMv4 - DIMSE deprecation??
  - How many modalities have adopted STOW-RS?
  - Vendor bridges could convert DIMSE to DICOMweb/V4
  - managing certs for encrypted DIMSE is a bit painful
  - increasing install base for DIMSE->HTTP bridges (e.g. AI vendor edge servers/gateways)
- Large Study Loading - 20,000 slice CT 5GB
  - 250MB of metadata!?
  - Took about 10-20 seconds to load with OHIF
  - Maybe a photon counting study?
  - Might prototype something here
- Apple Vision Pro
  - Interest from the radiology community - sirona, radai posting things
- HTJ2K Adoption - Encord - AI
  - Doing annotations of all kinds - medical images, video, etc
  - Following closely medical imaging technology
  - Stream entire DICOM P10 to client, can now decode HTJ2K encoded images
  - https://encord.com/blog/htj2k-support-for-dicom-files-encord/
- Other HTJ2K
  - fo-dicom now supports it
