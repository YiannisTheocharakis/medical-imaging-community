## Agenda

* Vector Databases - used in AI/ML
  * https://weaviate.io/
  
* HIMSS 2023 Feedback
  * Weird to be in McCormick Place and it not be RSNA
  * LLM / ChatGPT / AI/ML
    * Epic/MSFT ChatGPT integration
  * Felt very "vendor heavy"
  * AI more mature
    * More focus on solutions - what is meaningful to implement
  * "This is the last year of HIMSS before ChatGPT disruption"
    * Lots of vendors products will be replaced by ChatGPT solutions?
    * On the cusp of crazy change
  * Attendance ~ 40K - less than RSNA at its peak
  * More healthcare providers than vendors
  * Culture is different - more C level execs attending or presenting
    * More receptive to putting high level execs on stage to do talks
    * RSNA makes presentations more generic / no branding
  * Interoperability showcase - lots of floorspace (4x the size of the AI one at RSNA)   
  * Hot topics
    * Provider fatigue - hungry for any solution to help with this
    * Human resource shortage
  * ChatGPT Language Translation
  * Critcisms:
    * Shuttle service sucked
      * Frequency was lower
    * Missing Carpets!
    * Booth numbering was nonsense
    * Booths were smaller
      * Eisle ways were half - 1/3 as wide
  
* DICOM Pixel Formats - signed, unsigned, bits allocated, bits stored, high bit, number of components, photometric interpretation, endianess
  * How many of these are relevant w.r.t. backwards compatibility
  * Do you have to deal with this still?  YES
    * Implicit LIttle Endian is the only transfer syntax you can count on
  * AHLI tries to simlify this and transcodes everything to HTJ2K
  * NOTE: Compression algorithm headers override DICOM attributes
  * Movement in IHE to go towards FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) development of profiles
    * Challenges
      * FHIR standard is moving very quickly
      * Measuring standards compliance
    * IHE Compliance tool "Gazelle"
      * Groups trying to turn Gazelle into a FHIR compliance testing tool
    * Has not been a lot of collaboration between DICOM and HL7/FHIR recently
      * There should be more
      * Should be better linking between FHIR and DICOM
  * FHIR Implementation conformance framework:
    * https://inferno.healthit.gov/
  * DICOM Schema is "huge"
    * 4000+ attributes, many of which are not required
    * Multi-frame vs single frame
    * Private attributes
  * HL7 FIR r5 ImagingSelection Resource
    * https://build.fhir.org/imagingselection.html
  * Would be nice to have a layer that "normalizes" the pixel data?
    * CornerstoneJS does this to an extent because JavaScript is not strongly typed (pixel data is an array of numbers)
      * Doing more normalization than this would be probelmatic for some use cases
