- DICOM v4
  - Most providers are tredding water.
  - From David Clunie:
    - “Failed to show business value of DICOM V4” -> Tabled
    - Focus is on improving DICOM rather than a whole new version
    - Many people surprised by the outcome
  - Who are the members of the DSC?
    - Any voting member
- DICOM SC Color Images with 16 bits allocated / 8 bits stored - JPEG2000
  - Color images are typically 8 bits allocated / 8 bits stored
  - Nothing can decode these properly
    - DCMTK
    - Horos
    - CornerstoneJS/OHIF
  - Types of images - suspect some kind of gateway/router munged the images when transcoding to JPEG2000
    - Vital Images Vitrea
    - Philips IntelleSpace
    - Scanned Forms
- GTC Feedback from Mohannad
  - nVidia underestimated how many people would attend (last was in 2019 before covid)
  - 9,000 last time, 16,000 this time (convention center at capacity/movement was hard)
  - OHIF/Monai - lots of interest
  - NIMS - Wrap up any AI model in a docker image with an OpenAI spec and ship it for inference.
    - Like MAP but not imaging specific - domain agnostic
  - https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/#referrer=ai-subdomain
  - nVidia now has a suite of foundation models - generic enough they can offer as first party
    - Vista 3d - does segmentation on CT, etc
    - Vista 2d - ??
    - Maisi - Can generate images
