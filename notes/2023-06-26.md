## Agenda

* No meeting next monday July 3, 2023 due to holidays
* SIIM
  * High awareness of cloud in medical imaging
    * Year ago - "are you moving to the cloud"
    * This year - "we are moving to the cloud"
  * Heard of one customer who trained a generative ai model on the DICOM metadata and cloud ask it
    questions like "how many studies are CT Head with and without constrast"
  * One poster from emory used chatgpt to convert a radiology report into something more consumable by clinician/patient
    * https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37014240/
 * Azure released a capped egress program for express route
   * https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/expressroute/#pricing
* DICOM Supplement 223 SIIMcast
  * https://siimcast.libsyn.com/s6e13-dicom-supplement-223
  * From WG33 - focused on migrations
  * SIIM has been involved
* HTJ2K Supplement - moving to letter ballot
* AHLI
  * returns HTJ2K lossless only
    * Wanted to simplify building of medical imaging apps - only one codec 
    * wanted to ensure fast and cost effective applications
      * Avoid transcoding
      * Avoid differente user experiences due to variance in codec decode performance / conpression size
  * DICOMweb not supported yet - so no progressive that way, customers using aws sample for this now:
    * https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-healthlake-imaging-samples
 * Two best DICOM codecs for archviing (space)
    * JPEG2000
    * JPEG-LS <- best because much faster (10x) that JPEG2000 with similar compression ratio
    * Most vendors do not support JPEG-LS, but just the two:
      * JPEG Lossless <- preferred because faster than JPEG2000
      * JPEG2000
* Codec licensing issues contributed to the forking of Osirix into Horos
    * Also 64 bit support - which Osirix charged for
* Miele-lxiv - Osirix/Horos port to windows?
  * https://github.com/bettar/miele-lxiv  
  * WIP - a bit flaky/crashybuggy
