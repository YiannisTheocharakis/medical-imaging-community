## Agenda
- FHIR DevDays
  - Coming to Minneapolis in Early June, see https://www.devdays.com/registration-2024/
  - May not have a lot of coverage for imaging, but it is the premier conference for FHIR and healthcare workflows.

- DICOM v4
  - Chris attended, 80-90 in attendance, which is a lot for typical DICOM meetings.
  - Started by asking healthcare providers for their perspective
  - Some conversation about easing migrations, including to cloud migrations
  - Theme about data getting larger
  - Kevin O'Donnell taking notes
  - Not clear what the output of these consultations will be. Might need a roadmap
  - Chris pushing thoughts into his GitHub repo at https://github.com/chafey/DICOMV4
  - Alireza, Pantelis, Mike Ross and Khaled were in attendance
  - DICOM v4 might mean different things to different people. Monumental task. Need an agenda and a timeline to keep it organized. 
  - OT = Operational Technologist.
  - Chris - companies that want to succeed must be able to master operationalizing, e.g. automated testing, continuous integration. Example: https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/automating-safe-hands-off-deployments/
  - Next is 2 hours long (12-2pm Eastern on February 12th)

- TID1500 Questions
  - Mohannad was playing with sample TID1500 AI findings that contain annotations, e.g. POLYLINE. Wasn't working in vanilla OHIF. 
  - Khaled was aware of an initiative to map into FHIR. David Kwan talked about vendors taking that ininitative but didn't get far. David Clunie took it to WG-8 (structured reporting). Looking into it now (WIP).
  - Project week project related to TID1500 at https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW40_2024_GranCanaria/Projects/MHubTutorialsAndStructuredReportSupport/
  - Lack of adoption of TID1500 might be due to lack of interopability demand.

- Orthanc Licensing and Osimis
  - Osimis was spun up to provide commercial support for Orthanc, but they pivoted before COVID into AI Orchestration.
  - Sounds like Osimis will no longer contribute to Orthanc, there's an "Orthan Team" now.
  - Contribution rules were complicated, the newest annoucement makes cotnribution much easier.
  - Sebastien's announcement here: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7159212121430392832/
  - Licensing page update: https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/book/faq/licensing.html
  - Osimis has ceased to exist, instead we have https://orthanc.team/
