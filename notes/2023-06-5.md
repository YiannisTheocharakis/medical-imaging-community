* Cloud Native  https://siim.org/page/SIIM23_3015
    * What does it mean?
      * HITECH recommends that the location of data must be known - how does this work in a cloud setting?
      * Customers have difficulty explaining what it is
      * Spectrum
        * One extreme - not cloud native (lift and shift)
        * Another extreme - all managed services
        * Reality - somewhere in between
          * https://www.primevideotech.com/video-streaming/scaling-up-the-prime-video-audio-video-monitoring-service-and-reducing-costs-by-90
      * Depends on who is asking - a developer?  a radiologists?  an HIT employee?
      * Geographic distribution of resources - for increased availability
      * Customers mainly want reliability and scalability from cloud / cloud native 
      * Availablity, using micro services
      * One thing that IS NOT cloud native in medical imaging
        * DICOM DIMSE / Port 104 - must use web protocols (HTTP)
      * Can a customer buy a service, import DICOM and everything is managed by vendor going forward
      * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/six-advantages-of-cloud-computing.html
      * Lots of confusion from customers about what this is
      * Resources - cloud vendor frameworks
        * https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/business-outcomes/
        * https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-adoption-framework/
      * "An advantage might be if two health systems are cloud based, then merging might be easier."
      * "having per-customer deployments is probably a sign of poor cloud integration as well"

    * Why is it important?
    
    * How can I tell if a solution is cloud native?
        - SLA for data access
        - Multi-cloud solutions
        - Where the infrastructure is installed and managed - vendor account, your account or hybrid?
        - AWS Well Architecture Review
        - Are software updates automated or scheduled?
        - How frequently is the software updated?
        - Does the solution use commercial enterprise databases (SQL Server, Oracle) or cloud vendor provided databases?
        - Does the solution use more than one database?  
        - Does the solution use object storage (AWS S3) or file/block storage?
        - Does the solution leverage and expose cloud vendor provided identity and access control (AWS IAM)?
