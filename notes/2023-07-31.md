## Agenda

* Open Imaging Data Model
  * https://www.openimagingdata.org/
  * Ideally findings would be recorded into CDE (Common Data Elements) and then stored as FHIR Observations into EHR
    * Fully understood by EMR and incorporated into reports downstream
  * Involved: Epic, Nuance, SmartReporting
  * David: Huge pushback on CDE from clinicians, has failed in the past

* AWS HealthImaging
  * Why it was needed
    * ISVs had difficulty with cloud migration
      * too expensive
      * viewer was slow
      * not reliable
      * cost complexity / predictability
  * What is it?
    * Low Cost - https://aws.amazon.com/healthimaging/pricing/
      * Three pricing components
        * $/gb/month in archive -> $.006/GB/month (like S3 Glacier Instant Access $.004/gb/month)
        * $/gb/month in frequent access - $.105 / GB / Month
        * API Charges - $0.005 per 1,000 requests
  * Why is it the way it is?
  * How did it get built
