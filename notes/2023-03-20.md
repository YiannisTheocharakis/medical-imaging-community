## Agenda

* nVidia GTC - Kicked off today!
  * March 20-23
  * https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/?ncid=GTC-NV0MZR1P
  * Free!

* Generative AI and Medical Imaging
  * Generating Synthetic Image Generation (e.g. "CT Study with liver cancer")
  * Registration (e.g 2,000 slice .5mm CT registered with 100 slice 10mm CT)
  * Take non contrast CT series and generate a synthetic series that has contrast
    * https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/session-catalog/?tab.catalogallsessionstab=16566177511100015Kus&search=PS51314&ncid=GTC-NV0MZR1P#/
  * Dangerous to use clinically "its just made up data"
  * useful for developers - access to real world data is difficult
  * Concern about this generative data be mixed in with real data and polluting ground truth
    * DICOM Tags to help with this
  * Tie in with ontology/procedure codes - could this be used to help define terms, procedures?
  * Very useful for developers as they can capture the key features that define a procedure type (statistically equivalent)
  * DICOM Tags for manufacturer, model number as input?
  * Question - how does one create a generative ai for medical images?

* OpenAI "Whisper" (audio to text in 40 languages)
  * OpenAI requires a license to use - $20EU/month for API access?
  * https://github.com/openai/whisper
  * https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/create
  * Weights were released?  Whisper.cpp (open source?) - FREE
  * How well does it work with a radiology report?
    * Did ok, but replaced some terms with "more commmon" terms that sound similar
    * Perhaps some way to train this
    * used 
  * Can run without a GPU, WASM version in browser
  
* Microsoft Office 365 Copilot

  * Google has generative AI for google workplaces: https://twitter.com/benparr/status/1635684322261729282?s=12&t=sFpjko2Fp7Yl8nMqjSK8Xg
  
* Clinical Trial Data Modeling
  * Clinical Trial
  * 1:N Site
  * 1:N Subjects
  * 1:N Visit (baseline, week 4, etc)
  * 1:N Time Point (collection of data at a visit)
  * 1:N DICOM Studies
  * OMOP - should this be used for clincial trials
