## Agenda

* AWS HealthImaging Series?
  * The journey from day 1
  * Anything medical imaging is interesting
  * How AWS builds services
  * Digital Pathology related
  * What does a CloudNative / Modernized application look like with AHI?
  * What is so wrong with DICOM?  How can DICOMweb be improved?
* How often or if people are dealing with the problems of global latency
  * Centralized server in one location, users accross the globe
  * Are people doing this and is latency an issue?
    * Yes - mostly with pre-fetching and client side rendering
  * AWS Technologies/Services relevant
    * AWS DirectConnect - dedicated network connection from a location to an AWS Region
      * very low latency (<10 ms) 
      * High bandwidth = up to 100G
    * AWS Global Accelerator - routing traffic over the AWS internal network around the world
    * CloudFront - CDN with edge compute (Lambda@edge)
    * Edge Technologies
      * LocalZones
      * Snowcone
      * IOT Greengrass
      * Outposts
  * How does client side rendering help with latency?
    * it doesn't change network latency, but it makes the end user experience immune to it (as well as network variability)
  * 10 years from now:
    * Assuming: Redundant, high bandwidth, low latency networks are everywhere
    * Very few rads on premises
    * Don't need any local cache OR prefetching
        * Local Caching
            * Additional hardware $
            * Additional complexity $$ human and software
        * Prefetching
            * doesn't help with ad-hoc (<10%)
            * complex ($$ human it cost)
            * wasteful - prefetch same case to multiple rads just in case
  * Today -
    * First step is hybrid full archive on presmises, partial data in cloud
    * Second step is hybrid full archive in cloud, recent data (and maybe priors) on premises
        * Performance
        * Egress Cost
        * Third Party Applications
    * Third step is full archive in cloud, prefetching to local cache when needed
        * Very few here today (telerad company?)
    * Fourth step is full archvie in cloud, no local cache/prefetching
* Patient controlled copy of medical records (blockchain based)
  * Would this throw a kink in cloud systems
    * distributed file systems (IPFS/FileCoin/Chia) - these may make sense
