## Agenda

- DICOM v4

  - over 150 people interested
  - Initial meeting today at 11AM CST - probably logisitcs planning
  - Brainstorm of DICOMv4 Wish List

    - DICOM is not friendly enough for people who need to use it
      - AI Developers
      - Image Viewer developers
      - Analytics
      - First exposure to DICOM is tough
    - Documentation is too complex / hard to understand
      - Must be easier for new people to understand
      - Need for good "entry level" documentation
    - More focused on current state of the art
      - Get rid of parts that are not or rarely used
      - Simplify (fewer compression codecs)
      - Use modern codecs (json, etc)
      - Browsers, cloud
    - More real world use cases (like IHE)
    - DICOM Standard Process
      - Nothing should be standardized without an open source implementation
        - FHIR has a maturity model 0-5. "gazelle"
      - DICOM "Police" - some of kind enforcement, validation, verification
    - Basics/building blocks should be 100% solid and slowly changed
      - Ability to display an image properly (and generate a displayable image)
      - 2D, 3D, 4D, Cine Clips
    - Green / eco friendly / env friendly

  - Brainstorm of what we want to KEEP from DICOM v3

    - What does it do well?
      - Information model is good (what is a CT image?)
      - Acknowledgement (Storage Commitment)

  - What does DICOM not do well
    - Workflow
    - duplication of data between DICOM and HL7 - these should work together better
    - DIMSE/networking
    - Platform - AuthZ / AuthC, message bus, logging / auditing
    - DICOM Study filtering (usually end up downloading entire study)
    - Does not help with defining what a procedure/study and what a sequence/series is
      - RSNA Radlexx trying to do this
      - Various companies working on this
      - Big problem for AI and Hanging Protocols

- DICOM Structured Reporting TID 1500 Update
  - EU is trying to use TID1500 to serve up AI results (siemens, ge, phillips tried but failed?)
  - meeting last week - 40 people showed up
  - no easy solution with reporting - if we are going to do highly structured like SR, there is going to be thousands of templates
  - TID1500 does not handle "nesting" well - drop down selections
