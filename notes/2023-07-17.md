## Agenda

* AWS HealthImaging
* Yiannis looking for new opportunities
  * AlaraImaging - https://www.linkedin.com/company/alara-imaging-inc/
  * RadicalImaging - https://www.linkedin.com/company/radical-imaging/
  * Sectra - https://sectra.com/
* IHE Call for proposals is open (closes at end of month)
  * Brad Genereaux <bgenereaux@nvidia.com> toying with a proposalf for a paper on generative ai
  * https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Radiology_2023-2024_Development_Cycle
  * benefits: get access to experts, meet people with shared interests you don't know
  * Ideas
    * Mapping IHE serives to Cloud Services (how to cloudify)
      * White paper on "cloudifying IHE profiles".  Tips, tricks, considerations.  Written generically for cloud services
      * How to use similar IHE parts with cloud native sevices (e.g. UPSRS with AWS CloudTrail, AWS EventBridge)
      * SOLE/SWIM
  * AIWI - AI Workflow for Imaging https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/Radiology/IHE_RAD_Suppl_AIW-I.pdf
    * Triggered by DICOMweb UPSRS - create a workitem, send to orchestrator, orchestrator takes ticket and sends to everyone subscribe to jobs
    * Ticket describes where dicom is, where to put results, what type of data
* DICOMweb UPSRS
  * Like modality worklist but restful and more generic
  * Creat items in a list, someone can pickup the items, there is a status on each item
  * UPS has been part of dicom standard for > 10 years, joined the DICOMweb services back in 2015/2016
  * UPS has been in IHE for a while, part of the RRR-WF supplement (remote reading workflow)
  * https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/Radiology/IHE_RAD_Supp_RRR-WF.pdf
  * https://www.dicomstandard.org/using/dicomweb/workflow-ups-rs
  * Supports DICOMweb, FHIR endpoints
  * Technology - has APIS for WS (websockets) for push notifications and RESTful for polling
* SIIM Had a digital pathology webinar last week
  * Was rudimentary
  * First 15-20 minutes was covering the basics (background) - different focal lengths, pyramid
  * Second half was more of an advertisement for monitor vendor
    * Touch screen diagnostic monitor
* Monitor Calibration
  * SMPT Pattern
  * Monitor characterisitcs "Drift" over time - requires calibiration and monitoring
  * EU Group studies best monitors for digital pathology
    * 27" - no bigger?
  * https://www.aapm.org/ - professional society for medical physicists - created standards for diagnostic monitors
* Digital Pathology Slide Scanners
  * Microscope vendors are adopting DICOM
  * Philips (iSyntax) - DTS (Dynamic Transfer Syntax) Dr. Paul Chang
  * Leica
